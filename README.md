# Caesar Cihper

This code takes two arguments from the command line: a string of text to encrypt and the number of positions to shift each letter by. The program then encrypts the text using the Caesar Cipher method and prints the result to the console. The encrypted text is printed in blocks of five letters.

## How To Use

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/luminaa/github-lab
    ```

2. Then go to the file directory:

    ```bash
    cd ./github-lab
    ```

3. To use the code, run it from the command line and provide the string to encrypt and the number of positions to shift as arguments. For example:

    ```shell
    python caesar.py "Encrypt this text" 3
    ```

The above command will encrypt the string "Encrypt this text" using a shift of 3 and print the encrypted result to the console. This would be "HQFUB SWWKL VWHAW"
